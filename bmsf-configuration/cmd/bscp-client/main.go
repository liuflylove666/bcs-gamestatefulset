Publishing ConfigSet stepsï¼š
    bk-bscp-client init  -> bk-bscp-client add -> bk-bscp-client commit -> bk-bscp-client release -> bk-bscp-client publish

Explanation:
    First initialize the configuration file repository, and then add the configuration files to be submitted to the scanning area. Then, use the commit command to submit the scan area file (after submission, the content in the scan area will be cleared). Use the release command to select the commit record submitted and generate the corresponding release version. Finally, use the publish command to select the release version to be published for publication.
